# ss-sender
Sends the screenshot of the host.

Bot is mostly not kept online due to privacy reasons.

How to check on my server?
1. Join my server : https://discord.gg/a34r3haR
2. To check if bot is online, send message : $hello
3. If bot replies back, that means bot is online. Send message "$ss" to get the screenshot.

How to create this bot yourself?
Will be writing the answer in some time.
