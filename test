How to test and exprience it on my discord server?

1. Join my server : https://discord.gg/a34r3haR
2. To check if bot is online, send message : $hello
3. If bot replies back, that means bot is online. Send message "$ss" to get the screenshot.

You can also DM the bot.

P.S. : Bot is mostly not kept online due to privacy reasons.
